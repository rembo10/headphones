Anyway, for those seeing this I'm just doing this as I regularly use this product and I find it useful and wanted the latest version of the Headphones application avaialble in a docker image again so I can deploy it to my TrueNAS server.

I simply renamed the original README.md as README-ORG.md so please DON'T believe anything contained in it reflects to this project!

For now the only way to get the updated version is to clone this repository, do a docker build on the code and then create a custom yaml file to reference the new image. I'm currently testing this on my TrueNAS system and have it working well with a few minor issues that need sorting out.
