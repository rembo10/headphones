###Installation and Notes

This is a relatively early release of a third-party add-on for SABnzbd. It's been around for about a year, and while
quite functional, there are still a lot of kinks to work out!

To run it, just double-click the Headphones.py file (in Windows - you may need to right click and click 'Open With' -> Python) or launch a terminal, cd into the Headphones directory and run 'python headphones.py'.

For additional startup options, type 'python Headphones.py -h' or 'python Headphones.py --help'
