[**Troubleshooting** page](../../wiki/TroubleShooting) in the wiki can help you with comon problems.

**Issues** can be reported on the GitHub issue tracker considering these rules:

1. Analyze your log, you just might find the solution yourself!
2. You read the wiki and searched existing issues, but this is not solving your problem.
3. Post the issue with a clear title, description and the HP log and use [proper markdown syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) to structure your text (code/log in code blocks). 
4. Close your issue when it's solved! If you found the solution yourself please comment so that others benefit from it.

**Feature requests** can be reported on the GitHub issue tracker too:

1. Search for similar existing 'issues', feature requests can be recognized by the label 'Request'.
2. If a similar Request exists, post a comment (+1, or add a new idea to the existing request), otherwise you can create a new one.

If you **comply with these rules** you can [post your request/issue](http://github.com/rembo10/headphones/issues).

**Support** the project by implementing new features, solving support tickets and provide bug fixes. 
If you change something in the code always make a PR to the developer branch instead of the master branch.
